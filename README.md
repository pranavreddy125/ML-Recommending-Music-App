1. **Open the demo UI**  
   - Open in browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5500`  
   - Or, for the static demo (no backend): open `frontend/index.html` directly.

2. **Search for a song or artist**  
   - Type into the **Search** box and press Enter.  
   - Results show matching tracks and a **Recommend** column/list with similar songs.

3. **Build a playlist**  
   - Click **Add â†’ Playlist** on tracks you like to add them to the current playlist.  
   - The playlist panel updates with current selections and length.

4. **Export or inspect results**  
   - Export the playlist via **Export â†’ JSON/CSV** in the UI.  
   - Or run the CLI to get recommendations (prints JSON / writes to `./output/`):
   ```bash
   python src/recommend.py --user-id <id> --topk 10 --checkpoint models/best_checkpoint.pth
